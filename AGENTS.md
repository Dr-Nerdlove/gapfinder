Instructions for every AI tool working on this repository.

<!-- owner-rules v10: general (AGENTS.md) - begin -->

## General rules

### People

- Unless "Project knowledge" says otherwise, assume that the people you work with **do not program**: they
  build their projects together with AI assistants and rely on you for the code, its quality and its
  explanation. "Project knowledge" lists who works on the project.
- Talk to them in **German**, in plain words, without jargon. Say what changes for them, not which file
  changed.
- When they ask for ideas or something is unclear, **offer choices and let them pick before building**, with
  a recommendation. Do not build a proposal nobody chose.
- **Report honestly**: a test that failed, a step that was skipped, a fix that turned out to be wrong. Say
  what was **really tested** and what was only built or compiled, and what it means for them.
- **Merge, release or publish only when the person asks for it.** Never merge or overwrite the work of
  someone else without their consent; propose it to them (pull request, comment) instead.

### Language

- **Everything in the repository is English**: files and documentation, code comments, commit messages,
  branch names, pull requests, issues and release notes. Only the conversation with the people is German.
- Text that the product itself shows to its users (an app's interface, a device's display, its store page)
  stays in the language or languages the product is made for. "Project knowledge" names them.
- **A product in several languages stays in all of them.** Every new or changed text goes into every
  language the product offers, in the same change; never leave one language behind, drop one, or fall back
  to another language silently. Write each language naturally (not word for word), with its proper
  characters (ä, ö, ü, ß in German). Check that no text is missing in any language before calling the change
  done.
- Where a project still has older content in another language, do not translate it on your own: offer it as
  a choice.

### Testing

- Where the project has automated tests, **every new behaviour that can be tested automatically gets a test,
  and a sabotage check**: break the behaviour on purpose (it must still compile, and it must break the
  behaviour, not just a selector or a text), run the test, see it fail, put the code back and confirm that
  the file is byte for byte what it was (`cmp`). A test that passes against broken code is worthless.
- **What cannot be tested automatically** (hardware, devices, displays, animations, things that need a real
  account or service) gets no test suite of its own. Check it as far as possible (build, compile, a preview),
  then on the real device or service, and say plainly which part is checked how.
- Where the project has no tests at all, do not set up a test suite on your own: when a change would be
  risky without one, offer it to the owner as a choice.
- Run the project's checks before pushing, as "Project knowledge" or the project's own instructions say.
  Where they say nothing: the checks that cover what changed, and the whole suite when the change could have
  effects elsewhere.

### Safety and data

- **Never put secrets into the repository**: passwords, API keys, tokens, private addresses. Use the
  project's way of keeping them out (environment, settings, `.gitignore`); if there is none, ask.
- **Personal data** (of the people or of the product's users) is not sent anywhere new, logged or published
  without asking.
- **What users have stays usable after an update**: their settings, saved data, accounts. When a change
  would break or reset them, say so before building and offer a way to carry them over.
- **Ask before anything hard to undo**: deleting data or files that are not part of the change, rewriting
  history, changing a live service, publishing to a store.
- **New libraries or services** only with a reason, said in plain words; prefer what the project already
  uses.

### Changes

- **One topic per change** (branch, pull request): easier to check, to release and to undo.
- **One branch per task.** Create it from the latest default branch (usually `main`) with a name that says
  what the change is about: `type/short-topic`, lower case, English, words joined by hyphens - `feature/` for
  something new, `fix/` for a bug, `docs/` for documentation, `chore/` for tidying up (e.g.
  `feature/online-update`, `fix/ota-redirect-query`, `docs/ai-rules`). Not who or when, and nothing vague like
  `test` or `update2`. Push to that branch instead of the random branch name the environment gives the
  session; this is the owner's standing permission to push to such branches. A new task in the same session
  gets a new branch. Merge into the default branch only when the person asks for it; where others work on the
  project, propose the merge as a pull request instead. Where the project has its own naming habits, follow
  them.
- **After a merge or release, the new version is not everywhere at once.** GitHub keeps copies for a while
  (raw files and download links about 5 minutes, GitHub Pages about 10), and whatever a workflow builds or
  publishes only exists once its run has finished. Tell the person **how long to wait** (from the cache times
  and how long the project's last run took) and **how to check that the new version has arrived**: the run
  finished green under "Actions", the new version number in the app, on the release page or in the file, the
  new text on the page after a reload that bypasses the browser's cache. Where you can check it yourself, do
  so before calling it done, and say what you saw.
- **Commit messages and pull request titles** say in one line what changes, e.g. "Fix online update: keep
  the signed download URL"; more detail, and why, goes below.
- Changes that users notice go into the release notes or changelog in plain words (in English, like
  everything in the repository; texts shown to users inside the product or in a store, such as "what's new",
  in every language the product offers).

### Repository

Aim for what is common practice on GitHub, in proportion to the project: a small experiment needs less than
something others install. **Do not restructure an existing repository on your own**: point out what is
missing, with a recommendation, and let the people choose.

- **README**: what the project is (with a picture where it helps), how to install and use it, how to work on
  it (build, test, release), and its licence. Keep it up to date with every change that affects it.
- **Pull request descriptions**: what changes, why, how it was tested (and what was not), and anything the
  reviewer should know.
- **Automatic checks (CI)**: every push and pull request builds the project and runs its tests
  automatically; merge only when they pass. Where a project has none, offer to set it up.
- **Releases**: version numbers `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g. `v1.4.2`: major for breaking changes, minor for
  new features, patch for fixes). Files that are published are built by CI, never by hand. Each release says
  in plain words what is new and how to install or update.
- **Basics**: a `.gitignore` for build output and local files, a **licence** file (without one, nobody may
  legally reuse the code, even in a public repository; the choice of licence is the people's), and a
  `CHANGELOG.md` where releases alone do not tell the story.

### Showing changes

- Show visual changes rather than describing them: **screenshots** where the result runs on a computer.
- Where no screenshot is possible (a device, a display, a phone app, print): build a **preview** (a mock-up
  page, a pixel preview), or ask for a **photo** of the real thing.

### Checking facts at the source

- Do not build on memory where the real thing can be checked: read the actual source of a library, look at
  the real answer of a server or service, read the real data. Behaviour that "should" be so is often not.
- When a cause is unclear, **ask for a log or an error message before guessing**, and say what it would show.

### Keeping knowledge in the repository

- Sessions end and are deleted; the repository stays. What a later session needs to know goes into the
  project's files ("Project knowledge", the README, other docs, commit messages), not only into the
  conversation: decisions and why, traps that cost time, how to build, test and release, and the limits of
  the environment (what a cloud session cannot do there).

## Project knowledge

- **People:** The owner (GitHub `Dr-Nerdlove`) builds the project only with AI assistants (does not program)
  and decides about merging and releases. The users are the owner and their friends (10–20, at most 50),
  plus guests who vote through a share link.
- **Product:** A mobile-first web app that reads the friends' calendars (Google, Apple, Outlook, ...) and finds
  time slots where everyone is free, with sharing, voting and sending the chosen date. Repository name
  "Gapfinder"; the product's name is **"Lückenfüller"**. All decisions and the phases: `docs/PLAN.md`.
- **Product languages:** German only. All text shown to users is German (with ä, ö, ü, ß); there is no
  English interface. The texts live directly in the Svelte pages and components (`web/src/pages`,
  `web/src/components`); error messages for the server's error codes are in `web/src/lib/messages.ts`. The
  server never sends text meant for users, only codes (`ErrorCode` in `shared/src/index.ts`).
- **Architecture:** Static frontend on GitHub Pages; API server + SQLite in Docker inside a Linux VM (Hyper-V)
  on the owner's Windows PC, reachable only through Tailscale Funnel (nothing opened on the router). Details
  and reasons: `docs/PLAN.md`.
- **Build and test:** npm workspaces (`shared`, `server`, `web`), Node 24 in CI and Docker (22.13+ works
  locally). Before pushing: `npm run check`, `npm test`, `npm run build` (see README). CI (`ci.yml`) runs these
  plus a Docker build of the server on every push and pull request. Cloud sessions have no Docker daemon, so
  the image build is only verified by CI.
- **Release:** On every push to `main`, `deploy.yml` deploys the frontend to GitHub Pages and pushes the server
  image to GHCR (`ghcr.io/dr-nerdlove/lueckenfueller-api`, tags `latest` and `sha-<short>`). The VM updates
  itself hourly from GHCR and rolls back an image that is not healthy (`deploy/vm/update.sh`, guide
  `docs/server-setup.md`). Changes to `deploy/vm/` reach the VM only when the owner reruns `setup.sh`: say so
  in the release notes.
- **Traps:**
  - GitHub Pages only serves static files and has no fallback for app routes (use hash routing). Nothing
    secret (calendar links, tokens, keys) may ever end up in the static site.
  - The home PC is off from 01:00 to 07:00: the app must cope with an unreachable server.
  - Frontend (`github.io`) and API (`ts.net`) are different sites: no login cookies, use a token header.
  - The frontend updates immediately on deploy, the server only when the owner updates the VM: keep the API
    backward compatible.
  - The Funnel address is public; treat the API as exposed to the whole internet.
  - `shared` must be built (`npm run build:shared`) before the server or web can use it; the root scripts and
    the `predev` hooks do this, `npm test -w server` alone does not.
  - TypeScript stays on 6.x until `svelte-check` supports 7.
  - `docker compose pull` skips services with `pull_policy: never` (set in `deploy/vm/compose.yaml`), so
    `deploy/vm/update.sh` downloads with `docker pull`. The fake `docker` in `deploy/vm/test/` must behave like
    the real one, or the test passes against a broken script.
  - Fastify logs every request URL, and invite and password reset links carry their token in the URL: the
    request log masks them (`server/src/log-masking.ts`). New routes with a secret in the path must be added
    there.
  - The first admin account and an admin's own password reset come from the CLI in the VM
    (`server/dist/cli.js`, see `docs/server-setup.md`); the app itself never creates admins.
  - Backups (`deploy/vm/backup.sh`, nightly timer): made by the server's CLI (`backup`, `check-backup` in
    `server/src/backup.ts`) in a `docker compose run` container, encrypted with age to a public key; the secret
    key exists only with the owner, so the VM can never decrypt (trial restore and restore ask for it). Copied
    over SMB (`smbclient`) to a OneDrive folder on the Windows host, reached as the VM's default gateway
    (Hyper-V Default Switch). `smbclient ls` with no match exits 1 (`NT_STATUS_NO_SUCH_FILE`): that is an
    empty folder, not an error. Backup, restore and `update.sh` share `/opt/lueckenfueller/.maintenance.lock`.
    `deploy/vm/test/backup.test.sh` runs the real CLI (via tsx) behind its fake `docker` and needs `age`:
    both `ci.yml` and `deploy.yml` run `npm test`, so both install it.
  - Calendar key (`CALENDAR_KEY`, 32 bytes base64 in the VM's `.env`, made by `setup.sh`): the server must start
    without it or with a bad one (calendars then report "not set up"), never fail on it, or the VM rolls back
    the image before the owner can rerun `setup.sh`. The CLI's `backup` writes the key into the backup copy's
    `meta` table (`backup_calendar_key`); `backup.sh restore` takes it out (`take-calendar-key`, with
    `secure_delete` + `VACUUM`) and writes it into `.env` before the database is put in place. The live
    database never holds it; a `calendar_key_check` row (HMAC) tells whether key and database belong together.
  - Firewall (`deploy/vm/firewall.nft`, own nftables table, not Debian's `nftables.service`, which flushes
    Docker's rules): the container may only reach TCP 443 and DNS at 9.9.9.9/1.1.1.1. That is why
    `deploy/vm/compose.yaml` sets `dns:`: the VM's resolver (Hyper-V gateway or Tailscale's 100.100.100.100) is
    blocked. A new outgoing service the server needs must be added there. `deploy/vm/test/firewall.test.sh`
    tests the rules in network namespaces (root; CI runs it with sudo, `npm test` does not).
  - Database migrations must be additive: the VM rolls back to the previous image when a new one is not
    healthy, and that older server then runs on the already migrated database.
- **Repository:** Licence AGPL-3.0 (`LICENSE`, from the initial commit). Version scheme `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
  CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (checks) and `deploy.yml` (Pages + server image).
- **Limits of the environment:** Cloud sessions have no `gh` CLI; GitHub is reached through the GitHub MCP
  tools. A session cannot reach the owner's home server or create accounts with outside services (Tailscale,
  later Google/Microsoft); the owner does those steps from a written guide and keeps the keys in the VM, never
  in the repository.
