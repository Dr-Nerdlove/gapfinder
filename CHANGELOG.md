## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Phase 1b, the home server:
  - A step-by-step guide for running the server in its own small Linux VM on the home PC, reachable from the
    internet only through Tailscale Funnel, with nothing opened on the router (`docs/server-setup.md`).
  - A setup script that installs everything in the VM in one go.
  - The server updates itself about once an hour. If a new version does not start properly, it goes back to
    the previous version by itself. Debian, Docker and Tailscale install their security updates automatically.
- Phase 1a, the foundation of the app:
  - A first version of the app that opens on the start page and shows whether the server is reachable. When the
    server is off (nightly from 1 to 7 o'clock), it says "Lückenfüller schläft gerade" and offers to try again.
  - The look follows Material 3 and the phone's light or dark mode, and the app can be installed to the home
    screen.
  - The server with a health check, a small SQLite database that updates its own structure at start, strict
    settings for which websites may talk to it, and a Docker image for the home server.
  - Automatic checks and tests on every change, automatic publishing of the app to GitHub Pages and of the
    server image to the GitHub container registry.
